# TopoJSON Valibot

This package provides [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) schemas for validating [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification) data.

Schemas and their inferred types are provided for each constituent part of the TopoJSON format.


## Limitations

Some requirements of the TopoJSON scpecification are not fully validated by these schemas.

More details [here](https://github.com/sruenwg/topojson-validation#limitations).
