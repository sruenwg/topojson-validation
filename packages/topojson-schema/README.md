# TopoJSON Schema

This package provides [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/)s for validating [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification) data.

Similar to [geojson-schema](https://github.com/geojson/schema), self-complete schemas are generated for each constituent part of the TopoJSON format.


## Limitations

Some requirements of the TopoJSON specification are not fully validated by these schemas.

More details [here](https://github.com/sruenwg/topojson-validation#limitations).
