# TopoJSON Tests

This package contains examples of valid and invalid TopoJSONs (and constituent parts of the TopoJSON format) following the requirements listed in the official [TopoJSON specification](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification).

Note that this package considers anything not explicitly prohibited in the specification as valid, and recommendations (SHOULDs and SHOULD NOTs) are not considered.
